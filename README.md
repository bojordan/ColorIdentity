# Color Identity

**Theme-aware workspace coloring** — distinguish VS Code windows with colors that
harmonize with your active color theme.

Like [Peacock](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.vscode-peacock),
Color Identity tints your title bar, activity bar, and status bar so you can tell
workspaces apart at a glance. Unlike Peacock, the colors are **derived from your
active theme**, so they always feel like they belong.

## How It Works

1. Your workspace folder name is hashed to produce a **unique, deterministic hue**
2. The extension reads your current **theme kind** (Dark, Light, High Contrast)
3. Saturation and lightness are chosen to **harmonize with the theme** — muted
   darks for dark themes, soft pastels for light themes, bold accents for HC
4. Colors are written to workspace-level `workbench.colorCustomizations`
5. When you **switch themes**, colors automatically re-derive to match

The result: every workspace has a unique visual identity that always fits your
theme.

## Commands

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) and type
**Color Identity**:

| Command                                        | Description                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Color Identity: Choose Color…**              | Pick a color from named presets or enter a custom hue |
| **Color Identity: Apply Colors**               | Apply or re-apply identity colors          |
| **Color Identity: Reset Colors**               | Remove all identity colors from workspace  |
| **Color Identity: Refresh Colors for Current Theme** | Re-derive colors for the active theme |

### Color Picker

The **Choose Color…** command opens a quick pick with 14 named presets (Red,
Orange, Yellow, Lime, Green, Mint, Teal, Cyan, Blue, Indigo, Purple, Magenta,
Pink, Rose). Each option shows an **accurate color swatch** — a small PNG icon
rendered using the actual saturation and lightness from your current theme
profile. What you see in the picker is exactly what will be applied.

Additional options in the picker:
- **Automatic** — reset to the hash-based hue derived from your workspace name
- **Custom Hue…** — enter any value from 0 to 360

### Status Bar

A **Color Identity** indicator appears in the status bar. It shows the current
hue and whether it's automatic or overridden. Click it to open the color picker.

## Settings

| Setting                              | Type      | Default | Description                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `colorIdentity.enabled`             | boolean   | `true`  | Auto-apply identity colors on workspace open             |
| `colorIdentity.affectTitleBar`      | boolean   | `true`  | Colorize the title bar                                   |
| `colorIdentity.affectActivityBar`   | boolean   | `true`  | Colorize the activity bar                                |
| `colorIdentity.affectStatusBar`     | boolean   | `true`  | Colorize the status bar                                  |
| `colorIdentity.affectTabBar`        | boolean   | `false` | Colorize the editor tab bar background                   |
| `colorIdentity.saturationAdjustment`| number    | `0`     | Fine-tune saturation (-50 to +50)                        |
| `colorIdentity.lightnessAdjustment` | number    | `0`     | Fine-tune lightness (-30 to +30)                         |
| `colorIdentity.hueOverride`         | number \| null | `null`  | Override auto-detected hue (0–360); null = automatic |

## Examples

**Same workspace, different themes — the hue stays consistent, the tone adapts:**

- Dark theme → deep, muted navy
- Light theme → soft, pastel blue
- High contrast → bold, saturated blue

**Different workspaces, same theme — each gets a unique hue:**

- `my-api` → teal
- `my-frontend` → coral
- `my-docs` → lavender
